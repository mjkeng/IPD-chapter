  abstract = {Primary care is the 'first port of call' for weight control advice, creating a need for simple, effective interventions that can be delivered without specialist skills. Ten Top Tips (10TT) is a leaflet based on habit-formation theory that could fill this gap. The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that 10TT can achieve significantly greater weight loss over 3 months than ‘usual care’.}

  abstract = {This article develops a general framework to guide the use of subgroup cost-effectiveness analysis for decision making in a collectively funded health system. In doing so, it addresses 2 key policy questions, namely, the identification and selection of subgroups, while distinguishing 2 sources of potential value associated with heterogeneity. These are 1) the value of revealing the factors associated with heterogeneity in costs and outcomes using existing evidence (static value) and 2) the value of acquiring further subgroup-related evidence to resolve the uncertainty given the current understanding of heterogeneity (dynamic value). Consideration of these 2 sources of value can guide subgroup-specific treatment decisions and inform whether further research should be conducted to resolve uncertainty to explain variability in costs and outcomes. We apply the proposed methods to a cost-effectiveness analysis for the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome. This study presents the expected net benefits under current and perfect information when subgroups are defined based on the use and combination of 6 binary covariates. The results of the case study confirm the theoretical expectations. As more subgroups are considered, the marginal net benefit gains obtained under the current information show diminishing marginal returns, and the expected value of perfect information shows a decreasing trend. We present a suggested algorithm that synthesizes the results to guide policy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ten Top Tips (10TT) is a primary care-led behavioural intervention which aims to help adults reduce and manage their weight by following 10 weight loss tips. The intervention promotes habit formation to encourage long-term behavioural changes. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 10TT in general practice from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an individually randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 14 general practitioner practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: All patients were aged ≥18\,years, with body mass index ≥30\,kg/m(2). A total of 537 patients were recruited; 270 received the usual care offered by their practices and 267 received the 10TT intervention. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Health service use and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured over 2\,years. Analysis was conducted in terms of incremental net monetary benefits (NMBs), using non-parametric bootstrapping and multiple imputation. RESULTS: Over a 2-year time horizon, the mean costs and QALYs per patient in the 10TT group were £1889 (95\% CI £1522 to £2566) and 1.51 (95\% CI 1.44 to 1.58). The mean costs and QALYs for usual care were £1925 (95\% CI £1599 to £2251) and 1.51 (95\% CI 1.45 to 1.57), respectively. This generated a mean cost difference of -£36 (95\% CI -£512 to £441) and a mean QALY difference of 0.001 (95\% CI -0.080 to 0.082). The incremental NMB for 10TT versus usual care was £49 (95\% CI -£1709 to £1800) at a maximum willingness to pay for a QALY of £20\,000. 10TT had a 52\% probability of being cost-effective at this threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Costs and QALYs for 10TT were not significantly different from usual care and therefore 10TT is as cost-effective as usual care. There was no evidence to recommend nor advice against offering 10TT to obese patients in general practices based on cost-effectiveness considerations.
